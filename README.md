# Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Classification-for-Analysis-of-Human-Faces
### • Built Autoencoder in Tensorflow and applied Principal Component Analysis in Python for dimensionality reduction on images of human faces and compared performances of these two methods using their results from reconstruction and synthesis.
### • Implemented Fisher’s Linear Discriminant and applied it on reduced dimensions to distinguish male from female faces.
